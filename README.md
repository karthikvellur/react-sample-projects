Collection of simple ReactJS projects which i developed for fine-graining my skills on ReactJS & Javascript as part of Udacity's React Nano degree program

Each branch is a different project

The main project is on the branch 'contacts' which shows a list of contacts, with the ability of search, add and remove contacts

## Project Setup

* clone the Project and the desired branch
* install the dependencies - `npm install`
* Start the webpack server - `npm start`
