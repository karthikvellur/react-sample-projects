Collection of simple ReactJS projects which i developed for fine-graining my skills on ReactJS & Javascript as part of Udacity's React Nano degree program

Each branch is a different project

The main project is on the branch 'contacts' which shows a list of contacts, with the ability of search, add and remove contacts
